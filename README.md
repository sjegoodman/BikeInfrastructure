This project has 5 notebooks:.<br>
        1 - Bike Shops from FourSquare API<br>
        2 - Bike Infrastructure<br>
        3 - Background information about neighborhoods<br>
        4 - Analysis<br>
        5 - Model Building and Predictions<br><br>
    Questions this project aims to answer:<br>
    <ul><li>Which community areas (neighborhoods) have the most bike infrastructure, and which have the least?</li>
<li>Are there areas that show an unmet demand for bike infrastructure (higher rates of Divvy trips, but lower rates of bike lanes and repair shops)?</li>
<li>Can I predict bike infrastructure levels based on demographic or community health data?
